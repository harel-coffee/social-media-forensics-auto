# LIME Support for Arbitrary Character n-grams

This page contains code to support the use of arbitrary character n-grams to LIME.

To add character n-grams support to LIME, copy the file [lime_text.py](https://github.com/theocjr/social-media-forensics/tree/master/microblog_authorship_attribution/xai/lime/lime_text.py) to the [lime](https://github.com/marcotcr/lime/tree/master/lime) directory of the [LIME Project](https://github.com/marcotcr/lime).

This code was tested with Python 2 and [LIME version 0.1.1.36](https://github.com/marcotcr/lime/releases/tag/0.1.1.36) (added [here](https://github.com/theocjr/social-media-forensics/tree/master/microblog_authorship_attribution/xai/lime/lime-0.1.1.36.tar.gz) for convenience).

If you use this code, please, cite our [Paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9746262) ([BibTeX citation](https://github.com/theocjr/social-media-forensics/tree/master/microblog_authorship_attribution/xai/lime/icassp_2022/citation.bib)) published in 2022 International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP) and check our [results](https://github.com/theocjr/social-media-forensics/tree/master/microblog_authorship_attribution/xai/lime/icassp_2022) for the task of authorship attribution of small messages.
